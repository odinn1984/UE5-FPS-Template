# UE5 FPS Full Body Template
UE5 C++ only template for FPS with full body instead of just FPS arms.

This has basic FPS movement and ability to equip a weapon and simple collectables to replenish ammo.<br />
Has support for BP as well as pure C++ code (but can't create a BP project from this template)

## Installation Instructions

These are short instructions on how to download and where to add the template.

- Download the code or use `git clone` to get the source
- Go to the template folder in your UE installation path (e.g: D:\Unreal Engines\UE_5.1\Templates)
  - This was only tested on UE 5.1 no older versions
  - if you would like to run it on an older version please let me know if it worked :)
- Copy the content of the repository under a folder named "TP_FPBody" inside of the "Templates" folder from previos step

Once that is done you should be able to create a new C++ project in UE 5.1 with this template
